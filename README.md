# Elements-of-Computers-and-Programming
Assignments in the cs303e course.

"Objectives: 
This is a first course in computer programming. The purposes of the course are to learn fundamental computer science concepts including algorithm development, problem decomposition, variables, computation, parameters, conditionals, iteration, Strings, lists, lists of lists, dictionaries, sets, and working with files. By the end of the course students are expected to be able to implement programs consisting of roughly one hundred lines of code employing non trivial algorithms and multiple functions."
